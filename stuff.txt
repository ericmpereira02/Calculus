prob 1:

Because just 10 values were not enough to
confidently determine a limit, the first
10,000 terms of the sequence were calculated
rather than merely the first 10. In the list of
10,000 terms, the limit as x approaches infinity
can clearly be seen to be 0.

prob 2:

In the list of 10,000 terms, the limit
can clearly be seen to be 1/3.

prob 3:

In the list of 10,000, the limit
is clearly seen to be 0.6.

prob 4:

show proof.txt to describe

prob 5:
 
The sequence approaches two different
limits as x approaches infinity.

prob 6:

describe 4-cycle

prob 7:

Describe how it is close to the point at 3.543

prob 8:

describe point at 3.572

prob 9:

Period of 3 is noticed in the problem

prob 10:

Because 200 terms was not sufficent to
make a clear desicion about whether or not
the sequence is chaotic, 200,000 terms were
calculated. From this data, it is determined
that the sequence is a period-5 cycle.
